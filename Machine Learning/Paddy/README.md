# Paddy Disease Detection - HarvestHero

This repository contains the essential files and resources for the HarvestHero Paddy Disease Detection. The goal of this project is to accurately detect and classify various paddy diseases using machine learning models. Below is a detailed description of each file included in this folder:

## Descriptions

1. **Paddy_Desease_Detection.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete workflow for training and evaluating the paddy disease detection model. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

2. **Paddy_Desease_Tuning.ipynb**
   - This is Jupyter Notebook for tuning hyperparameter to achive high accuracy. Using this method i got 91% val_acc for paddy disease detecton. 

3. **Google Drive Link of TFJS Model and h5 Model**
   - The pre-trained model file saved in HDF5 format and everything that paddy disease detection also on there. [(Click Here)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/199JR3UVaszvKIS13z8m7NUi1PsrV7nrn?usp=sharing)

6. **Paddy Disease Detection Dataset**
   - [Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification/data)

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the Bangkit Academy 2024 Capstone Project: "HarvestHero" initiative to aid paddy farmers in early detection. The dataset used for training the model was compiled from various reputable sources, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive collection of paddy leaf disease images.
